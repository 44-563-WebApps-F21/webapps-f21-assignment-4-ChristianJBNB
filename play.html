            </h2>
            <h3>
                Act IV Scene: The Court of Justice: the walls are hung with stamped grey velvet:
                above the hangings the wall is red, and gilt symbolical figures bear
                up the roof, which is made of red beams with grey soffits and
                moulding: a canopy of white satin flowered with gold is set for the
                Duchess: below it a long bench with red cloth for the Judges: below
                that a table for the clerks of the court.  Two soldiers stand on each
                side of the canopy, and two soldiers guard the door; the citizens
                have some of them collected in the Court; others are coming in greeting
                one another; two tipstaffs in violet keep order with long white wands.
