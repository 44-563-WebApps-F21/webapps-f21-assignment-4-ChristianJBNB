                The Duchess of Padua
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Act IV Scene: The Court of Justice: the walls are hung with stamped grey velvet:
                above the hangings the wall is red, and gilt symbolical figures bear
                up the roof, which is made of red beams with grey soffits and
                moulding: a canopy of white satin flowered with gold is set for the
                Duchess: below it a long bench with red cloth for the Judges: below
                that a table for the clerks of the court.  Two soldiers stand on each
                side of the canopy, and two soldiers guard the door; the citizens
                have some of them collected in the Court; others are coming in greeting
                one another; two tipstaffs in violet keep order with long white wands.

                    <p class="speech moranzone">Is the Duke dead?</p>
                <h4 class="name">SECOND CITIZEN</h4>
                    <p class="speech seccitizen">He has a knife in his heart, which they say is not healthy for any man.</p>
                <h4 class="name">MORANZONE</h4>
                    <p class="speech moranzone">Who is accused of having killed him?</p>

                    <p class="speech seccitizen">Why, the prisoner, sir.</p>
                <h4 class="name">MORANZONE</h4>
                    <p class="speech moranzone">But who is the prisoner?</p>
                <h4 class="name">SECOND CITIZEN</h4>
                    <p class="speech seccitizen">Why, he that is accused of the Duke’s murder.</p>
                <h4 class="name">MORANZONE</h4>
                    <p class="speech moranzone">I mean, what is his name?</p>
                <h4 class="name">SECOND CITIZEN</h4>
                    <p class="speech seccitizen">Faith, the same which his godfathers gave him: what else should it be?</p>
                <h4 class="name">TIPSTAFF</h4>
                    <p class="speech tipstaff">Guido Ferranti is his name, my lord.</p>
                <h4 class="name">MORANZONE</h4>
                    <p class="speech moranzone">I almost knew thine answer ere you gave it.  <br>[_Aside_.]<br>

                        Yet it is strange he should have killed the Duke,
                        Seeing he left me in such different mood.
                        It is most likely when he saw the man,
                        This devil who had sold his father’s life,
                        That passion from their seat within his heart
                        Thrust all his boyish theories of love,
                        And in their place set vengeance; yet I marvel
                        That he escaped not.<br>
                     
                                                                [_Turning again to the crowd_.]<br>
                     
                        How was he taken?  Tell me.</p>
