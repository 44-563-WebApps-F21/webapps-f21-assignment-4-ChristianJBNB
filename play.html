                The Duchess of Padua
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Act IV Scene: The Court of Justice: the walls are hung with stamped grey velvet:
                above the hangings the wall is red, and gilt symbolical figures bear
                up the roof, which is made of red beams with grey soffits and
                moulding: a canopy of white satin flowered with gold is set for the
                Duchess: below it a long bench with red cloth for the Judges: below
                that a table for the clerks of the court.  Two soldiers stand on each
                side of the canopy, and two soldiers guard the door; the citizens
                have some of them collected in the Court; others are coming in greeting
                one another; two tipstaffs in violet keep order with long white wands.                
            </h3>
            
                <h4>MORANZONE</h4>
                    <p>Is the Duke dead?</p>
                <h4>SECOND CITIZEN</h4>
                    <p>He has a knife in his heart, which they say is not healthy for any man.</p>
                <h4>MORANZONE</h4>
                    <p>Who is accused of having killed him?</p>
                <h4>SECOND CITIZEN</h4>
                    <p>Why, the prisoner, sir.</p>
                <h4>MORANZONE</h4>
                    <p>But who is the prisoner?</p>
                <h4>SECOND CITIZEN</h4>
                    <p>Why, he that is accused of the Dukeâ€™s murder.</p>
                <h4>MORANZONE</h4>
                    <p>I mean, what is his name?</p>
                <h4>SECOND CITIZEN</h4>
                    <p>Faith, the same which his godfathers gave him: what else should it be?</p>
                <h4>TIPSTAFF</h4>
                    <p>Guido Ferranti is his name, my lord.</p>
                <h4>MORANZONE</h4>
                    <p>I almost knew thine answer ere you gave it.</p>
